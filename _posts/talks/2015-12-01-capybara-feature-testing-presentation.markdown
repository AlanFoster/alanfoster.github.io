This presentation provides a high level overview of how to begin testing your web applications
with [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) which provides a Domain Specific Language for writing browser level feature tests for your web application, and [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) the Ruby test runner.

It discusses testing from the outside in, as well as the benefits of testing, and test driven development.
Importantly this presentation also provides detail on common race-conditions and issues associated with
feature driven development, and suggests methods to deal with these scenarios.
