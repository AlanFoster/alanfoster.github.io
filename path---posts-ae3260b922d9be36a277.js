Importantly they can be used reduce fragile tests, and promote DRYness - via the encapsulation of common functionality within simple methods. In plain terms: A page object is an instance of a  class  which abstracts the underlying user interface from your tests, providing methods to interact with the UI, and extract any required information.

They perform logic based on switch statements. For instance they may do: Sure, this is fine. But it's not exactly very flexible is it? It's not taking advantage of the fact that enums can offer logic within the enum itself. For instance enums can offer a public abstract void method, which all enum constants must override and implement logic to. For instance This means we can now execute our logic by doing…"}},{node:{id:"/Users/alanfoster/Documents/Shopkeep/alanfoster.github.io/src/pages/posts/welcome/index.markdown absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{title:"Welcome",date:"04 May, 2011"},fields:{slug:"/posts/welcome/"},excerpt:"Hello, I am Alan Foster and I hope you enjoy reading my first blog post.
