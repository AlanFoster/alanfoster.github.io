## Commands

Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) defines useful command line utilities
that developers can make use of. The list in its entirety can be found [here](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/utilities.html).

A developer can survive with a subset of the command line utilities, for instance:

* awk
* cat
* cd
* cp
* less
* mkdir
* pwd
* wc

## ls

`ls` is useful to list a directory's contents.
