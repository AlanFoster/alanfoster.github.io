## What is Jest?

Jest is a simple test runner for JavaScript. Out of the box it has very
sensible defaults, which can be referred to as Zero Configuration. It is also configurable
if required.

Out of the box it provides:

- Expect
  - A powerful assertion library
- Jest-Mock
  - For simulating the behavior of a real object
- Snapshot Testing
  - Storing the previous output of a function for future comparison
- Running tests in Parallel
- Built-in code coverage reports
- ... and more
