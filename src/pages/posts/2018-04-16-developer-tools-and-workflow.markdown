It's important for developers to discuss their tools and work flow, it's how we can learn from one another.

### Last Pass

Last Pass is a great **password manager** that can help generate unique, complex, passwords for all of the services that you sign up to.

It also has a great Mobile app, so you can always be secure.

### Tamper Monkey

[Tamper Monkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) is great for **running custom scripts** on arbitrary websites. You can use it to either change the user interface, or functionality of a website. For instance, I have used it as part of my development cycle to:

* Provide auto-completion for frequently filled out forms
* Log analytics requests, rather than send them
* User Interface tweaks, such as modifying or hiding functionality

If you use Firefox, then you may find [Grease Monkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) useful.

### Lighthouse

Lighthouse is great for **measuring website quality**. It generates reports highlighting issues with performance, accessibility, and SEO best practices.

### uBlock Origin

[uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) A great **ad blocker**.

### React Developer Tools

The React developer tools are great for viewing the React element heirachy, analysing props, and viewing needless redraws. A must have for a React developer.

### Immutable.JS Object Formatter

[ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) provides immutability within JavaScript via a simple API. However, when logging these objects to the console - they are not printed in a useful way:

### JSON Formatter

At the time of writing, Chrome does not support pretty printing of JSON within the browser:

[JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en) steps in and provides this functionality:

## ColorPick Eyedropper

[ColorPick Eyedropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg?hl=en) is useful for extracting the colors directly within the browser.

## Dimensions

## Development Tools

### docker

Docker is great for bringing up local containers, and for consistent deployments.
For instance it is very easy to [run react unit tests within docker](/posts/2017-06-03-running-react-unit-tests-within-docker/).

### Kitematic

I am a fan of using command line tools, but sometimes a nice user interface can be appreciated.

Kitematic is a user interface for docker with all of the bells and whistles available:
