[React-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) boosts an impressive list of features. Importantly it allows
for developers to create native mobile applications using JavaScript and [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

This presentation highlights the developer friendly ecosystem, and powerful developer workflow that can be applied.

Including, but not limited to:

* Declarative Component / View creation using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* Debugging via Chrome's developer tools
* [Hot module reloading](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2016/03/24/introducing-hot-reloading.html)
* Time traveling and state management with [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
