[React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is a new and upcoming open source technology, maintained by Facebook, for creating complex user interface components - usually within the context of a Single Page Application.

Within this presentation I discuss a high level overview of React.js, describing the concepts of Pure and Composite components, eventually delving into more complex topics such as the flux pattern, build tools and testing.
